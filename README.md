# SimpleForexDB
A very simple self updating database pulling data from Yahoo Finance.


This is a very brief personal project to demonstrate some of the techniques I have learned over my journey.

The scope is very simple, create a self-updating database that keeps track of a single forex pair. 

Once this project is complete, I will not be expanding upon it here.
